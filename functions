//In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
//Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
//You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); 
//Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. 
//All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.



//Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. 
//When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters.
//The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

//Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
//Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");.
//We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World.
//Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. 
//Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.
function functionWithArgs(word1, word2) {
  console.log(word1, word2);
}
functionWithArgs("My", "Sharona")
//output is My Sharona in the console

function functionWithArgs(word1,word2) { //create a new function that accepts two values
  console.log(word1 + word2); //when this function is called, add the two values together and output them in the console
}
functionWithArgs(12,5) //adds 12 + 5. console output is 17
