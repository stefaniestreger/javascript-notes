//You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
//is the equivalent of
i = i + 1;
//Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

var myVar = 87;
myVar = ++myVar; //this will increment myVar by +1

//The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
//Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

//Usage: In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
//Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

//Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
//In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. 
//Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
myVar = myVar + 5;
//to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

//One such operator is the += operator.
var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
//6 would be displayed in the console.

//compound assignments are usually [declared variable] += [another thing]
//[thing] += [variable] doesn't work and produces a syntax error
