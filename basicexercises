//create a function to add any two numbers together
function addTwo(num1, num2); { //defines what values the function should take
   let answer = num1 + num2; //defines variable used inside of function - add nums together
   return answer; //defines what happens when variable is called
}


//create a function to find the average value of an array of numbers


//create a function to check if a number is odd 


//write a loop 0-100 that only prints [odd/even] numbers (pick odd or even) 


//create a function to reverse a string


//create a function to check if two strings are the same


//create a function that returns the longest string in an array (or the highest number)


//write a loop from 0-100 that stops when it hits 25 (end the loop early)


//write a loop from 0-100 and on every multiple of 3 log "fizz", every multiple of 5 write "buzz" and on multiples of both write "fizzbuzz"


//modify this program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" when divisible by either 3 or 5)


/*write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using new-line characters to separate lines
at each position of the grid, there is either a space or a # character
the characters should form a chessboard
define binding size of 8, and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height
