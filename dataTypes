// JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object

//In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'
//typeof 3 returns the string number, and typeof '3' returns the string string.
