// Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
// They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
// Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.


//It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
var a = 7;
var myVar = 0;

//When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
//If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
//If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of undefined.

//Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase.
//In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

//Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. 
//There are two reasons to use escaping characters:
//To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
//To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash
