// Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
// They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
// Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.


//It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
var a = 7;
var myVar = 0;

//When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
//If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
//If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of undefined.

//Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase.
//In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
